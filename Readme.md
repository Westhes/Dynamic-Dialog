# Dynamic dialog
A project meant for the development of the tool.
The dynamic dialog system aims to make it easy to create different branching conversations in Unity.
This was greatly inspired by a similar tool created by Aarthificial, which inspired me to create a similar tool for my own uses.

It's currently very work in progress although an MVP has already been created.
From here on out it's just polishing and fine-tuning the project until it becomes a solid and robust tool for future projects.
